# Data-Scrapping-From-E-Commerce
Scrap data from Amazon  and List Product currently under Discount

This project is designed to scrape product data from Jumia, an online e-commerce platform, specifically listing all products currently under offer. The scraped data is then used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and is displayed using a web-based UI created with Streamlit.



## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Web Scraping:** Extract product information from the Jumia website using Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and `Scrapy`.
- **EDA:** Analyze the scraped data using `pandas` and `numpy` to gain insights.
- **UI Development:** Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to display the data.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Automatically scrape product details, including names, prices, discounts, and availability.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform EDA on the scraped data to visualize and understand trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **Streamlit UI:** Display the analyzed data on a Streamlit web application, allowing users to interact with and explore the data.
